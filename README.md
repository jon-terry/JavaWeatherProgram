# Java Weather Program

This CLI program is designed to take in a user's name and their email address, and send them a weather report with a short listing data for the next hour.
It uses the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides) and [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
